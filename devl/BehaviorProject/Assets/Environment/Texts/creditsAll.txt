<b><size=15>Virtual Plasencia Version 1.6 -- A Revealing Cooperation and Conflict Project Endeavor</size></b>

Our project is an international collaboration (The Revealing Cooperation and Conflict Project) involving nine universities in Spain, Switzerland, and the United States of America. The project is an independent scholarly endeavor organized within MappaMundi, a digital humanities initiative of the University of Texas at Austin. MappaMundi graciously provided seed-funding for the creation of Virtual Plasencia, as well as ongoing intellectual and technical counsel. MappaMundi is directed by Dr. Geraldine Heng (University of Texas) and Dr. Ece G. Turnator (University of Texas).
