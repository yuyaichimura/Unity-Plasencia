The villages neighboring Plasencia were at the heart of the conflict as these Señores disputed the traditionally recognized jurisdiction of the city council over its neighboring villages. What ensued was a fierce regional conflict over natural resources (grazing, fishing, and agricultural rights), taxation, and secular leadership in the region.

In particular, Christian commoners and religious minorities such as Jews often found themselves trapped in the mechanics of these conflicts. For example, Rabbi Abraham de Loya of Plasencia was taken captive and singled out for harsher treatment when his hands were not bound, but instead “shackled in chains”. Although the rabbi survived, two of his coreligionists were not as fortunate.
