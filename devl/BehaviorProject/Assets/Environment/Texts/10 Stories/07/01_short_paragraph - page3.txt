The sheepherders Juan and Pascual Sánchez of Tornavacas reported they had seen men transporting the “bodies of Fartalo and his wife”, both Jews from Plasencia, to the village of Oropesa (the location of the Señor de Oropesa’s castle). 

Eventually, although the Carvajal-Santa María confederation would effectively resolve jurisdictional hurdle in 1431, it was not a permanent solution. The Señor de Oropesa and Señor de Valverde had proved worthy adversaries of the confederated families, but they would be insignificant in comparison to the Estúñiga family, who the king made the Condes de Plasencia (the Counts of Plasencia) in 1441. When the Estúñiga family assumed this new role -- the ultimate secular authority in Plasencia -- it was if the enemy had breached the gates.
