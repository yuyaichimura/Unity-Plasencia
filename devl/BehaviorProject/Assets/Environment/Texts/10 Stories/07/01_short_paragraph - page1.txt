In Plasencia during the 1420s the city council and the Cathedral of Plasencia served as the de facto local secular and ecclesiastical authorities in the region surrounding the city of Plasencia. Often, their jurisdictional and taxation authority was challenged by regional lords that only answered to the king, such as the Señor de Oropesa (the Álvarez de Toledo family) and the Señor de Valverde (the Niño family).  When local city councils and local lords could not agree on how to balance the needs of these jurisdictions, the king’s supreme authority was required to settle disputes. 

During the late 1420s, at a time when the Santa María and Carvajal families were the most powerful families in the city of Plasencia, the Señor de Oropesa and the Señor de Valverde challenged their economic and political power bases.
