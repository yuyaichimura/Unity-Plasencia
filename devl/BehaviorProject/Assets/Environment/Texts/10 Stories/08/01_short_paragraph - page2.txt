In a detailed 1443 listing of vineyards in the vicinity of the village of Trujillo (just 80 kilometers to the south of Plasencia) we notice that Muslim leases were a part of family tradition of winemaking. At the periphery of Trujillo, the Cathedral of Plasencia first leased lands with grapevines to Mahomet del Corral, and after his agreement expired (or was not renewed), his brother Aiza Luengo, took on the property. As in the prior example of La Salgada, these wine-producing lands were adjacent to a community of vineyards one of which was rented by Alonso Martinez Lucero, a Christian, and another by Omat Sillero, a Muslim.
