Winemaking was a perennial interest of Jews, Christians, and even, Muslims. 

Even though Muslims were prescribed from drinking wine by the Qur’an, this did not prevent some of the Extremaduran (an ethnic group living in Extremadura, between the center and the south-west of Spain) Muslim families of Plasencia from owning, renting, and managing their own production of wine. Church records from 1414 show that Muslims were involved in winemaking, as well as other religious groups. For example, this document mentions that a Christian, Alfonso Fernandez Alfagerme, assumed the lease of a vineyard known as “La Salgada”. The vineyard was surrounded by a cluster of other vineyards owned by Marta Fernandez, Juan Gutierrez, and lastly, a Muslim individual referred to as “Ali”. Ali’s vineyard carried a distinct name, “El Caballo”, or “the horse”.
