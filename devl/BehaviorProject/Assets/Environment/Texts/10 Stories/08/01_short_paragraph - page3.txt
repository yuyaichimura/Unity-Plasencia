Jewish families also participated in the wine tradition of the region, but apparently, to a lesser extent as they were represented more thoroughly in local urban trades. With the Edict of Expulsion of 1492, all Jews were forced leave territorial Spain.

In the Edict of 1492 several Jewish families can be identified as vineyard owners.
