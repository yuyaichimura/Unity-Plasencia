During the late 1420s, the Santa María and Carvajal families were the most powerful families in the city of Plasencia. Among those families that challenged their economic and political power bases were the Estúñigas, who the King of Castile and Leon would appoint as the Condes de Plasencia (Counts of Plasencia) in 1441. To counteract the power of the king-appointed Estúñiga family, the Santa María and Carvajal families resorted to using the power of the local bishop, who happened to be a Santa María himself.
