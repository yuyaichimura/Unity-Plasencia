During Gonzalo García de Santa María’s term as bishop (1424-1445), the local knight and church families used a combination of personal wealth, church authority, and church statutes to block Count Pedro de Estúñiga’s attempt to solidify control over the region and its inhabitants at the opening of the 1440s. Jewish inhabitants were especially threatened by the aggressive and predatory property purchases made by the Estúñigas within the Jewish quarter. It is significant that the Estúñiga’s new palace (the Palacio de los Mirabeles) was adjacent to the synagogue and the Jewish homes of the Jewish quarter.
