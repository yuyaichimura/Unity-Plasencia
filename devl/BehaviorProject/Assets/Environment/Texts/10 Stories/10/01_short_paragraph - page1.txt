Prior to end the fifteenth century, the Jewish quarter in the southwest section of Plasencia was the most religiously and socially diverse in the city. The Jews constituted forty-two percent (42%) of the total population in Plasencia and the impact of the ratio of population figures is reflected in how the leaders of this community, specifically the Cathedral of Plasencia’s ecclesiastical leadership, chose a path of cultural inclusion during the mid-fifteenth century. (See “Historical Background” by visiting the communal fountain in the Plaza de San Nicolas). For example, Bishop Gonzalo García de Santa María (tenure 1424-1446), himself a Jewish convert to Catholicism, significantly increased access to housing leases for Jewish and Muslim families. While the former church leadership only leased four percent (4%) of church houses to religious minorities, the bishop-convert and his functionaries directed twenty-two percent (22%) of all leases to Jews and Muslims.
