This amounted to an almost six-fold increase in access for Jewish and Muslim tenants.
 
Typically, the cathedral’s Jewish and Muslim tenants were tradesmen, as opposed to religious leaders like Plasencia’s rabbis who tended to live in Jewish-owned homes. The cathedral’s clients included a Muslim family of tailors (the Chicala family), as well as Jewish shoemakers (the Aruso family), clothing-shearers (the Caces/González families ), blacksmiths (the Arrañon family), and military arms makers (the Capas family). The church’s decision to lease property in greater numbers to Jews and Muslims in Plasencia indicates that they were inclined to support the traditional approach of peaceful co-existence of the three faiths.
