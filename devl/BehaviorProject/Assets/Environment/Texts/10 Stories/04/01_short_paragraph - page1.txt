In the late 1390s, the knight Diego Gonzalez de Carvajal was a young man and likely just entering his third decade of life; his lineage and family connections suggested he had a promising and prosperous life ahead of him.  He was the son of a well-established caballero (knight) in Plasencia and the son-in-law of Comendador (Knight Commander) Diego Garcia de Ulloa, a leader of knights in Aldeanueva.   
 
Diego Gonzalez de Carvajal wrote his testament gives in 1455, a few years before his death. The testament gives one the impression of a very wealthy man who bequeathed over 62,000 maravedis (silver coins) in money to heirs, and one who owned an extensive housing complex, with its own “palacio”, on the main plaza in the city of Plasencia in addition to a varied portfolio of properties in the vicinity, including twenty-three stables, several vineyards, an income-generating grain mill, and over two-dozen other houses and lands.
