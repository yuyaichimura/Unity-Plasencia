In 1422, Dr. Gil Martínez de Soria weakened the strongest family in the Cathedral of Plasencia -- the Fernández -- by exposing their corrupt governing practices. In the aftermath, the Santa Marías captured the Archdeaconship of Coria and now would sit alongside of the Carvajal clan who recently won the Archdeacon of Plasencia and Béjar.  To gain cathedral power, these two families needed to decrease the power of its rivals and place even more allies in key positions. An opportunity arose with the death of one archdeacon and the appointment of a new one from the Martínez family. This change ended the Fernández family’s influence on the chapter. With the Dr. Gil Martínez’s cooperation, the new makeup of the chapter fell decidedly into the arms of the family partners.
