In the early 1420s, of the fourteen identified members of the cathedral’s governing chapter, four were Santa Marías, one was a caballero Carvajal, another a caballero Almaraz (intermarried with the Santa Marías and Carvajals), and two were Martínez clansmen. Only one Fernández family member remained on the chapter. With a dominant position on the cathedral chapter, this new converso-caballero federation of families secured the bishop’s mitre for Gonzalo García de Santa María in 1424.  The conversos had taken the cathedral.
