At the opening of the 15th century, transformational events transpired in the Kingdom of Castile and Leon. Among the most important were the massive anti-Jewish “pogroms” of the 1390s, the generation of new noble families, and the significant impact of a new Castilian group -- Jewish converts to Catholicism (conversos). Remarkably, just as anti-Jewish fervour was increasing, so was the power of former Jews (like the Santa Maria family) who aligned themselves with the lower nobility (like the Carvajal family of caballeros/knights).

The quest to capture a cathedral was no small undertaking and it endow its victors with incredible familial economic opportunities. To partake in a church diocese’s opportunities necessitated formal seats on cathedral leadership chapter (for example, archdeaconships) and monopolistic friends.
