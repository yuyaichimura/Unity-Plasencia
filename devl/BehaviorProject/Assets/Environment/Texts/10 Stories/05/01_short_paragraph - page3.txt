Just as the king had the power to appoint so the king had the power to take it back. In 1488 the Carvajal family managed to eject the Condes de Plasencia (Counts of Plasencia) from the city at the request of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabel and restored the city to direct royal rule. Nonetheless, in the forty-seven years of Estúñiga’s governance (1441 to 1488), it was primarily the Carvajal and Santa María families that would consistently test the limits of the count’s authority until 1488 when they effectively put an end to the count’s power.
