The city of Plasencia enjoyed the benefits of a city charter (fuero), in which the King of Castile and Leon established the rights and privileges of the city. The “great malice” (1441-1488) was the naming of a new lord over the city and his attempts to force the cathedral and city to yield to his rule. Thus, in December of 1441, King Juan II appointed Pedro de Estúñiga as Condes de Plasencia (Counts of Plasencia). The king expected the Cathedral of Plasencia and the city council to receive Pedro as their new lord in spite of the customary privileges the city exercised through the city charter. Further, the king authorized the count to assume all “peripheral lands, tribute taxes, notary fees, trade taxes, rents, and all rights over the city.”
