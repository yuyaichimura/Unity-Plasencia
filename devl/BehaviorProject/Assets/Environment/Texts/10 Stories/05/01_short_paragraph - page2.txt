Consequently, the year 1441 brought the rapid expansion of the Estúñiga family into the affairs of the city of Plasencia, and with their arrival, they planted the seeds for a forty-year conflict with the Carvajal and Santa María families who governed the Cathedral of Plasencia. (The Palacio de los Mirabeles, pictured in Virtual Plasencia, was the count’s residence). The Estúñiga’s new palace was adjacent to the synagogue and the Jewish homes at the heart of the Jewish quarter.

As the counts settled into Plasencia, both churchmen and city councilmen alike described their relationship with their new lord as follows: “The conflict, hatred, and ill will that exist now are a sign of the great malice of our times.”
