Within the apartamiento there were two zones —one area contained the synagogue and multiple Jewish homes, and the other area included the dwellings of Tel Diaz de Vega, a local Christian city councilman (regidor). In 1416, the city council forced Tel Diaz to forfeit his properties inside of La Mota to Alvaro de Sande due to unpaid debts. Property passed through multiple hands leaving Fernándo de la Mota as the final purchaser. Eventually, this residential zone would take his last name (“Neighborhood of La Mota”).
