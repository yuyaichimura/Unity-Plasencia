Despite being a safe community for its Jewish residents, Plasencia was not free of anti-Jewish sentiment. Ever since the 1390s and the massive anti-Jewish riots that characterized this period, Jews in the Kingdom of Castile resided in a religiously-charged environment that placed their communities in jeopardy. Sometime before 1416 several Jewish families found it necessary to live in a fortified and gated collection of homes in Plasencia known as the Apartamiento de La Mota. (Within Virtual Plasencia V1.0 we present the location of these homes, but not its gate.)
