<b>"La Mota": A Christian Assumes Ownership over Jewish Homes, circa 1416</b>

Despite being a safe community for its Jewish residents, Plasencia was not free of anti-Jewish sentiment. 

Ever since the 1390s and the massive anti-Jewish riots that characterized this period, Jews in the Kingdom of Castile resided in a religiously-charged environment that placed their communities in jeopardy. 

<nextpage> Sometime before 1416 several Jewish families found it necessary to live in a fortified and gated collection of homes in Plasencia known as the Apartamiento de La Mota. (Within Virtual Plasencia V1.0 we present the location of these homes, but not its gate.) 

Within the apartamiento there were two zones — one area contained the synagogue and multiple Jewish homes, and the other area included the dwellings of Tel Diaz de Vega, a local Christian city councilman (regidor). 

<nextpage> In 1416, the city council forced Tel Diaz to forfeit his properties inside of La Mota to Alvaro de Sande due to unpaid debts. 

Property passed through multiple hands leaving Fernándo de la Mota as the final purchaser. Eventually, this residential zone would take his last name (“Neighborhood of La Mota”). 

Fernando allowed the Jewish families to continue to reside in them, but to affirm his status as landlord, he performed a customary ritual of taking ownership. The scribe recorded that:

<nextpage> <i>Fernándo entered into the houses lived in by Yucef Castaño [and other Jewish residents]. These houses, the best of all of them, had been owned by Tel Diaz.  [Fernándo] took possession of the homes by physically walking into them...and then he closed all of its doors.  He then opened the doors and shook the hands of Ledicia and her husband,</i> <i>Symuel Abenabibe, and all of the other Jews living in these homes.</i>

In this manner, Fernándo de la Mota proceeded to secure all of his houses in the apartamiento.
