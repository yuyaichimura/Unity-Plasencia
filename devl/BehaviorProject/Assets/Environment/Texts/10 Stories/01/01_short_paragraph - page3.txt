Fernando allowed the Jewish families to continue to reside in them, but to affirm his status as landlord, he performed a customary ritual of taking ownership. The scribe recorded that:

<i>Fernándo entered into the houses lived in by Yucef Castaño [and other Jewish residents]. These houses, the best of all of them, had been owned by Tel Diaz.  [Fernándo] took possession of the homes by physically walking into them...and then he closed all of its doors.  He then opened the doors and shook the hands of Ledicia and her husband, Symuel Abenabibe, and all of the other Jews living in these homes.</i>
