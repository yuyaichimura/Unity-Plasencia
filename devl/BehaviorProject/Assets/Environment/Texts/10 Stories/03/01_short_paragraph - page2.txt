the city was cheated out of these revenues. 

On the matter, the cityâ€™s notary reported:

<i>The lords of the cathedral are allowing the transportation of wine by its clergy into the city.  This occurs in opposition to our ordinances, as the city council has not consented to this.  Further, when wine tax collectors confront the clergy carrying the wine in, the clergy threatens to present them with a letter of excommunication.  Now, we remain at this impasse.</i>
