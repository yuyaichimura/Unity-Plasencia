<i>All churchmen can freely bring wine into the city.  Even taking one or two measures (azumbres) of wine to any person that you wish is acceptable.  However, if you are to bring more than this amount, you are not to sell it to anyone for any price, whether that is in the public square or on the street corner.  Further, I order my Provisor and Vicar General to regularly check with the wine tax collectors to see if any churchman is transporting hidden wine along with livestock, whether that is in the city or at its periphery.  If any churchman violates this order or the city ordinance, we will present them with a letter of excommunication.</i>
