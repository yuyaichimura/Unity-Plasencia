<b>Churchmen and Their Illicit Wine Dealings, circa 1428 </b>

Unlike the city-cathedral portazgo (tax collected at a city gate) agreement of 1428, the issues surrounding wine in the city of Plasencia displayed the hallmarks of a simmering, unresolved conflict. 

The problems began when the city council suspected that unnamed churchmen were abusing their privileges.  

These liberties allowed the cathedral’s men to bring wine into the city free of locally imposed tariffs provided the wine was for church or personal use. 

<nextpage> However, the city believed that churchmen were transporting wine under the guise of church/personal use, but then selling it below the cost of taxed wines. 

Not only were wine merchants impacted by this alleged covert activity, but more importantly, from the perspective of the city council, the city was cheated out of these revenues. On the matter, the city’s notary reported:

<nextpage> <i>The lords of the cathedral are allowing the transportation of wine by its clergy into the city.  This occurs in opposition to our ordinances, as the city council has not consented to this.  Further, when wine tax collectors confront the clergy carrying the wine in, the clergy threatens to present them with a letter of excommunication.  Now, we remain at this impasse.</i>

Rather than attacking the church’s abuse of their wine privileges, the councilmen emphasized the importance of protecting the rights of the church and promoting harmony in the community.  

<nextpage> In January 1428, Mayor Alonso Arias confirmed the city council’s commitment to protect the church’s wine privileges. 

The bishop, on his part, ruled that the churchmen would not bring wine to the city for the purpose of selling it. Bishop Santa María explained:

<i>All churchmen can freely bring wine into the city.  Even taking one or two measures (azumbres) of wine to any person that you wish is acceptable.</i>

<nextpage> <i>However, if you are to bring more than this amount, you are not to sell it to anyone for any price, whether that is in the public square or on the street corner.</i>  

<i>Further, I order my Provisor and Vicar General to regularly</i> <i>check with the wine tax collectors to see if any churchman is transporting hidden wine along with livestock, whether that is in the city or at its periphery.</i>

<i>If any churchman violates this order or the city ordinance, we will present them with a letter</i> <i>of excommunication.</i>
