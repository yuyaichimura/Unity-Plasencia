Among the named items subject to the toll tax were livestock, honey, olive oil, vinegar, butchered meats, bacon, salted fish, wool, cloth, iron, timber, and glazed tile. In the case of each of these goods, together the city council and cathedral determined a specific tax to be collected for each item. For instance, at the lower end of tax assessments, the city and church agreed to levy a tax of one dinero coin for each slab of bacon.  At the upper end, the city and church collected two maravedis coins for honey of “higher quality” and one maravedis coin for honey of a “lesser quality”. With the cathedral-city agreement in place -- honey and bacon were free to flow into Plasencia again.
